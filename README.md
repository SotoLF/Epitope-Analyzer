# Epitope-Analyzer
Several immunoinformatic tools are available to predict T-cell epitopes from protein amino acid sequences. However, there are few available programs to analyze, visualize, and filter these epitopes. These programs are usually not user-friendly nor graphical and require considerable programming skills. Here, we developed Epitope Analyzer within the Shiny/R framework. This Shiny app includes five relevant tools to analyze the properties of the epitopes such as (1) their distribution across major histocompatibility complex (MHC) alleles, (2) their density and (3) location in each protein, (4) the number of binding MHC alleles per epitope, and (5) the set of epitopes shared by multiple MHC alleles. Epitope Analyzer removes the programming barrier and provides intuitive tools allowing easy interpretation and graphical representations to facilitate epitope selection.
